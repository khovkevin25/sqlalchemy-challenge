# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we used Python and SQLAlchemy to perform an analysis and data exploration on climate from a climate database, such as looking at precipitation and temperature.

The resources used in this analysis can be found in the "Resources" folder. In this folder, there are two CSV files ("hawaii_measurements.csv" and "hawaii_stations.csv") and a SQLite file (hawaii.sqlite).

The main codes used in this analysis can be found in the "ClimateAnalysis" folder. In this folder there are two files with code: "app.py" and "climate_analysis.ipynb".
